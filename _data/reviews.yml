    It was a pleasure working with Devon to repair our ceiling in our closet. We chose to repair it rather than
    replace. Devon walked us through what that would look like, offering the most cost-effective option. He was
    very professional. I recommend working with him!

    I recently hired Devon for a bathroom remodel, and my wife and I couldn’t be happier with the results.
    From start to finish, Devon was professional, punctual, and detail-oriented. He took the time to listen
    to what we wanted, offered helpful suggestions, and executed everything with precision. Devon kept the
    work area tidy throughout the project and completed the job on time without cutting corners. It’s rare
    to find someone who truly takes pride in their work the way Devon does. I’d highly recommend him.

    I hired Devon Tyler for tile work in my home and was impressed by his patience, precision, and professionalism.
    He took his time to get every cut right and made sure the job was solid and clean. I’d absolutely recommend
    him to anyone looking for quality tile work done with care.
