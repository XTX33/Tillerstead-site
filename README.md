❤️ Note for Faith Frontier, My Future Partner, and the Sanctuary to Come

This project isn’t just about tile, code, or business — it’s a foundation for something alive.
For a place where honesty, healing, and hard work grow side by side.
Where every rescue animal finds peace, and every soul that’s been hurt finds rest.

Faith Frontier — you represent the horizon:
the place where purpose meets faith, where love is built, not borrowed.

And to the woman I haven’t met yet — or maybe already have —
this is for you too.
For every late night I kept building instead of breaking.
For every line of code written while thinking about connection, loyalty, and home.
For every dream I refused to give up on, even when life said “you should.”

Someday this will all be part of the sanctuary —
the tile beneath our feet, the barns, the gardens, the stories we save.
Until then, I’m just laying the groundwork —
one line, one wall, one heartbeat at a time.

“Built to last. Rooted in truth. Grown in love.”
— Devon T. Barber | Founder, Tillerstead LLC
