title: "Large-Format Tile Done Right: Flatness, Mortars, & Trowels"
description: "Installing large-format tile in South Jersey? Here’s how Tillerstead ensures flat substrates, the right mortar choice, and consistent coverage for floors and walls that stay beautiful."

Large-format tile (anything **15″ and larger on any side**) delivers that modern, seamless look homeowners love—but it only performs when the prep and materials meet **industry standards**.

At **Tillerstead LLC**, we follow **TCNA** and **ANSI A108/A118** guidelines for flatness, bonding, and coverage—so your large-format floors and walls stay flat, tight, and durable for years.

## ⚖️ Flatness Matters

Tile only follows what’s beneath it.  
The **TCNA Handbook (Method TR115 & TR117)** requires substrates for large-format tile to be:

- **1/8″ variation in 10 ft** (no more than 1/16″ in 24″) for tiles **<15″**,  
- **1/8″ in 10 ft or better** for tiles **≥15″**,  
- Checked with a 10-ft straightedge before setting.

We **grind or float high/low areas** before setting tile, using self-leveling underlayments or patch compounds as needed. That prep work prevents **lippage** and the hollow sound that means incomplete support.

> **Pro Tip:** The bigger the tile, the less forgiving the substrate.  
> Flatness tolerance shrinks as tile size increases.

## 🧱 Mortar Selection (ANSI A118.4 / A118.15)

Large-format and gauged porcelain panels need **improved bond strength** and **non-sag performance**.  
We select mortars that meet or exceed:

- **ANSI A118.4** — *Modified thin-set mortars*  
- **ANSI A118.15** — *Improved high-performance mortars*  

**What we use:**
- *LATICRETE® 4-XLT*, *MAPEI® Ultraflex LFT*, or *Custom® ProLite®* for large-format floors and walls  
- *Extended open time* for layout flexibility  
- *Non-sag or medium-bed properties* to support heavier tiles

**Why it matters:**  
Ordinary thinset (A118.1) can slump under heavy tile, leading to uneven bond lines and hollow spots.

## 🔧 Trowel & Coverage Technique

Every large-format job depends on coverage—the percentage of mortar actually touching the tile’s back.

**TCNA and ANSI A108.5 require:**
- **≥80% coverage** for dry areas,  
- **≥95% coverage** for wet areas (showers, floors),  
- No voids larger than 2 in² and none within 2″ of tile edges.

**Our method:**
1. Select a **trowel size** that matches tile back geometry (often 1/2"×1/2" or Euro-notch).  
2. Apply mortar with **parallel ridges** in one direction.  
3. **Back-butter** large tiles to fill depressions.  
4. **Lift and check** the first few pieces to confirm coverage and collapse of ridges.

> Proper ridge direction and trowel angle (45°) help air escape, ensuring continuous contact between tile and substrate.

## 🧩 The Result

- **Tight joints** with minimal lippage  
- **Clean lines** across the field  
- **Full bond**—no hollow sounds  
- **A floor that meets spec and lasts**

**Summary:**  
Large-format tile rewards precision. Whether you’re planning a porcelain floor in **Egg Harbor Township**, a shower wall in **Galloway**, or a full bath remodel anywhere in **Atlantic County**, Tillerstead ensures your surfaces meet the flatness, mortar, and coverage standards that make tile last.

**Next Step:**  
Schedule your consultation or send project photos to **info@tillerstead.com** to verify your substrate is ready for large-format tile.
