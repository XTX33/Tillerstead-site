description: "A simple 15-minute prep guide for South Jersey homeowners—photos to take, measurements to grab, and how Tillerstead builds a clean, fair proposal for tile and bathroom projects."

If you’ve never hired a property maintenance or remodeling contractor in New Jersey, the first consult can feel like a mystery. The goal with **Tillerstead LLC** is simple: a calm walkthrough, clear expectations, and a proposal that reflects your real space—not guesswork.

This guide shows you how to prep in about **15 minutes** so your consultation (in Atlantic County or anywhere in South Jersey) is efficient and accurate.

## What we look at (and why it matters)

During a tile or bathroom consultation, we’re not just “eyeballing it.” We’re checking the things that decide whether your project lasts:

- **Moisture risk**  
  Where water actually goes, not just where we hope it goes. We look at splash zones, corners, and any history of leaks to plan for **true waterproofing**, not just “water-resistant” products.

- **Substrate & flatness**  
  Tile follows what’s under it. Large-format tile especially needs flat, stable planes to avoid lippage and hollow spots. We assess subfloor, backer board, and any humps or dips.

- **Structure & transitions**  
  How your floor system, thresholds, and nearby rooms tie together. We’re looking at deflection, height changes, and how tile will meet carpet, LVP, or hardwood without creating trip points.

- **Ventilation**  
  Fans, duct runs, and how steam leaves the room. In South Jersey’s humidity, a strong, correctly ducted fan helps your grout, paint, and framing last longer.

- **Lifestyle fit**  
  How you actually live: cleaning habits, color preferences, and tolerance for grout lines and textures. A low-maintenance family bath gets different recommendations than a rarely used guest suite.

## Five photos to take before we talk

Good photos let us give you a realistic starting estimate without playing phone-tag. Aim for:

1. **Full room view**  
   Stand in the doorway and capture floor, walls, and ceiling in one shot.

2. **Wet area close-ups**  
   Show the shower or tub surround, including corners, valve wall, and any obvious issues.

3. **Threshold and floor at the doorway**  
   We need to see transitions—the step into the bath, adjoining flooring, and any height differences.

4. **Problem areas**  
   Cracked grout, loose tiles, soft spots at the tub or shower edge, or staining—anything that has you concerned.

5. **Exhaust fan and ducting**  
   A photo of the fan and, if visible, the duct or vent termination in attic or exterior.

> **Pro tip:** If you can, also snap the **shutoff valves**, **trap/drain**, and any **access panel**. Those small details help us plan demo and tie-ins without surprises.

## Quick measurements to have ready

You don’t need to be perfect—just close enough to understand scale and material needs:

- Room **length × width**  
- **Ceiling height**  
- **Wet area length × width** (shower or tub surround)  
- Planned **tile size** (e.g., 12×24, 24×48, mosaics on floor)  
- Any **niche, bench, or ledge** ideas  
- Preference for **linear drain vs. center drain**

These basics help us talk honestly about layouts, waste factor, and whether leveling or framing corrections are needed.

## How Tillerstead prices clearly

Every project is different, but the structure of our proposals stays consistent so you know what you’re signing:

1. **Scope from demo to finish**  
   A plain-language breakdown of what’s included—demo, disposal, prep, waterproofing, tile setting, grout, caulk—and what’s not (plumbing moves, electrical, glass, etc.), so there are fewer surprises.

2. **Methods & standards in plain English**  
   We state the waterproofing system and installation approach in writing, tied to manufacturer instructions and industry standards (TCNA/ANSI), without burying you in jargon.

3. **Materials that match your tile**  
   Mortars and grouts appropriate for your tile and use:  
   - modified thinset mortars meeting **ANSI A118.4/A118.15** where required,  
   - grout type (sanded, unsanded, or high-performance),  
   - sealants and movement joints where needed.

4. **Documentation & accountability**  
   Where applicable, we document:  
   - **Flood tests** for shower pans,  
   - **Substrate flatness checks**,  
   - Any pre-existing conditions you should know about.

5. **Schedule with cure times spelled out**  
   We outline demo days, setting days, and realistic cure times for membranes, grout, and sealers so you know when you can safely use the shower or bath again.
