title: "Your First Tile/Bath Consultation in NJ: What to Expect & How to Prep"
description: A 15-minute prep that can save you days—photos to take, measurements to grab, and how we write a clean, fair proposal.

If you’ve never hired a tile/bath contractor, the unknowns can feel stressful. Here’s how **Tillerstead LLC** runs a consult so your project starts clean and finishes right.

## What we look at (and why)
- **Moisture risk:** Where water wants to go; true waterproofing, not just “water-resistant.”
- **Substrate & flatness:** Tile follows what’s under it; large-format demands flatter planes.
- **Structure & transitions:** Deflection, thresholds, heating/cooling swings.
- **Ventilation:** Fan CFM and ducting—steam needs a path out.
- **Lifestyle fit:** Cleaning preferences, grout color tolerance, maintenance appetite.

## Five photos to take
1. Full room view (include ceiling/floor)  
2. Wet area (corners/valve wall)  
3. Threshold/floor at doorway  
4. Any cracked grout/tile or soft spots  
5. Exhaust fan and visible ducting

> Tip: Snap the **shutoffs**, **trap/drain**, and any access panel. Small clues save big time.

## Quick measurements
Room L×W; ceiling height; wet area L×W; intended tile size (e.g., 12×24, 24×48); niche/bench ideas; linear vs center drain.

## How we price clearly
1. **Scope** (demo → finish) with inclusions/exclusions.  
2. **Method** (system + standards) stated in plain English.  
3. **Materials** (mortars meeting ANSI A118.4/A118.15 where required; grout class; sealants).  
4. **Documentation** (flood test photos where applicable; substrate flatness notes).  
5. **Schedule** with cure times explained (for grout, sealers, and membranes).
