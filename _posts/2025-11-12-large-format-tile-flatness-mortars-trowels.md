title: "Large-Format Tile Done Right: Flatness, Mortars, & Trowels"
description: Big tiles need flatter planes, the right mortar, and consistent ridges for full support.

Large-format tiles (≥15") look amazing—if the substrate is truly flat.

## Flatness matters
We prep planes to suit the **tile size and layout**. Proper prep reduces lippage and eliminates hollow spots.

## Mortar selection
We use mortars meeting **ANSI A118.4/A118.15** where required. For heavy/large tile, non-sag and extended open time help.

## Trowel & coverage
- Choose trowel size to match tile back geometry.  
- Create parallel ridges; back-butter large tiles.  
- Lift-and-check early to confirm full support.

**Result:** Tight joints, clean lines, durable floors/walls.
