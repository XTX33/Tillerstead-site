title: "Waterproofing 101: RedGard® vs Schluter® KERDI vs LATICRETE® HYDRO BAN®"
description: "Compare three leading shower waterproofing systems—RedGard, KERDI, and HYDRO BAN—with their pros, pitfalls, and how Tillerstead installs them to spec under NJ code and TCNA standards."
---

Even the best tile work will fail if the waterproofing system beneath it isn’t installed **exactly to manufacturer spec**. At **Tillerstead LLC**, we build every shower in line with **ANSI A118.10 (waterproof membranes)**, **A118.12 (crack isolation)**, and the **TCNA Handbook** (details B422, B421, B415, etc.), so you know your system isn’t just pretty—it’s **documented, warrantable, and durable**.

Below is a field-tested comparison of three common systems available through local supply houses and big-box stores like Home Depot or Floor & Decor.

## 🔴 RedGard® (Custom Building Products) — Liquid-Applied Membrane

**Type:** Roll-/trowel-on liquid waterproofing meeting *ANSI A118.10*  

**Best for:** Budget-conscious installs over cement board or mortar beds  

**Pros:**  
✅ Widely available  
✅ Flexible for irregular shapes  
✅ Low material cost  

**Keys to Spec-Compliant Use:**  
- Apply **two or more coats** at a **wet-film thickness of ~30–35 mils**; verify with a wet-film gauge  
- Reinforce **plane changes and penetrations** with alkali-resistant mesh per manufacturer sheet  
- Allow full **cure (typically > 24 hrs)** before flood testing per **IAPMO PS 106** guidelines  

**Common Failures:**  
⚠ Under-thickness or pinholes  
⚠ Skipped mesh at seams or corners  
⚠ Premature flood testing before full cure

## 🟠 Schluter® KERDI — Sheet Membrane System

**Type:** Polyethylene sheet membrane bonded with unmodified thin-set (ANSI A118.1)  

**Best for:** Full rebuilds needing testable seams and integrated drains/pans  

**Pros:**  
✅ Waterproofing directly at surface  
✅ Compatible with KERDI-Drain and prefabricated pans  
✅ Easy to flood-test before tile  

**Keys to Spec-Compliant Use:**  
- Embed sheets in **unmodified thin-set mortar (ANSI A118.1)** over clean substrate  
- Maintain **2″ (50 mm) overlaps** and **roll seams** to eliminate voids  
- Use **KERDI-Band, KERDI-Corners, and KERDI-Fix** sealant where required  

**Common Failures:**  
⚠ Skipped seam overlap or poor embedment  
⚠ Using modified thin-set that voids warranty  
⚠ Unsealed fastener holes at benches or niches

## 🟢 LATICRETE® HYDRO BAN® — Premium Liquid-Applied Membrane

**Type:** Liquid membrane meeting *ANSI A118.10 & A118.12*  

**Best for:** High-performance, elastic waterproofing under tile in showers, steam rooms, and exteriors  

**Pros:**  
✅ Highly elastic and crack-isolating  
✅ No fabric required at most changes of plane  
✅ GreenGuard-certified, low-VOC  

**Keys to Spec-Compliant Use:**  
- Apply at **0.02 in (0.5 mm) dry-film thickness**; verify coverage rate (≈ 50 sq ft per gal @ two coats)  
- Reinforce any large movement joints or gaps with **LATICRETE Waterproofing/Anti-Fracture Fabric**  
- Allow **2 hrs between coats** and **24 hrs cure** before flood test (per LATICRETE TDS 410)  

**Common Failures:**  
⚠ Under-applied thickness or skipped corners  
⚠ Mixing with incompatible sealants or mortars

## ⚖️ Our Professional Approach

Rather than forcing one product into every job, **we choose the system first**, then pair compatible mortars, sealants, and tapes by the **same manufacturer**.  
That ensures:

- Full warranty coverage under manufacturer specs  
- Predictable cure times and bond strengths  
- Consistency with **NJ Residential Code (IRC P2709)** requirements for shower receptors  

We document every waterproofing phase—**photos, flood-test logs, and substrate flatness checks**—so your finished shower isn’t just beautiful, it’s **built to spec and proven watertight**.
