title: "Waterproofing 101: RedGard vs Schluter® KERDI vs HYDRO BAN®"
description: Pros/cons, install flow, and the common failure points we prevent on every job.
---

All three systems can deliver durable showers when installed to spec. Most failures come from **missed seams, wrong thickness, or incompatible materials**.

### RedGard (liquid-applied)
- **Pros:** Accessible, flexible, cost-effective.  
- **Keys:** Two or more coats to spec; mesh/tape where required; full cure before flood test.  
- **Common failures:** Thin spots, pinholes, rushing cure time.

### KERDI (sheet)
- **Pros:** Surface waterproofing; seams are visible/testable; integrates with KERDI drains/pans.  
- **Keys:** Proper thinset; tight, rolled seams; corner pre-planning.  
- **Common failures:** Skipped banding or poor seam embedment.

### HYDRO BAN (liquid-applied)
- **Pros:** Highly regarded, elastic; strong tech docs.  
- **Keys:** Coverage rate and cure; reinforcement at plane changes.  
- **Common failures:** Incomplete coverage; incompatible sealants.

**Our approach:** Pick the **system first**, then match mortars/tapes/sealants per manufacturer instructions so performance and warranty align.
