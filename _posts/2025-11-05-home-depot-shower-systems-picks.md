title: "Home Depot Picks: Good–Better–Best for Shower Systems"
description: What you can buy today—and how we combine it with pro methods for a durable, watertight result.

You can buy a lot of what you need for a great shower at Home Depot. Here’s a **good–better–best** overview and when we recommend each. We install to **manufacturer specs** and document waterproofing so your shower stays watertight.

## Good: Liquid-applied over cement board (e.g., RedGard)
**Shines when:** Standard layout, budget-conscious.  
**Keys:** Required coat thickness (verify with a wet-film gauge), full coverage at corners/penetrations, proper cure time.  
**Pros:** Readily available, flexible detailing, cost-effective.  
**Watch-outs:** Most failures = too-thin coats or missed spots.

## Better: Sheet membrane (e.g., Schluter® KERDI)
**Shines when:** Visible seams you can test; consistent waterproofing; compatible drains/pans.  
**Pros:** Waterproof at the surface; flood tests are clear.  
**Watch-outs:** Seam rolling; correct thinset; corner planning.

## Best: Foam board + integrated pan (e.g., KERDI-Board, GoBoard)
**Shines when:** Full rebuilds, large-format tile, benches/niches, tighter timelines.  
**Pros:** Flatter planes, fewer fasteners in wet zones, lighter handling.  
**Watch-outs:** Follow fastening patterns; brand tapes/sealants.

**Bottom line:** Store-bought parts can work brilliantly—**if** the system is assembled to spec with proper movement joints.
