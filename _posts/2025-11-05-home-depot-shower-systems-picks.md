You can buy a lot of what you need for a solid, watertight shower at **Home Depot**—if you know what you’re looking at. The key is combining **store-bought systems** with **professional prep and methods** that meet manufacturer specs and **TCNA standards**. That’s how **Tillerstead LLC** builds lasting showers across Atlantic County and South Jersey.

Below is a **Good–Better–Best** breakdown to help you understand where each system shines—and where to be cautious.

---

## 🟢 Good: Liquid-Applied Waterproofing (e.g., RedGard®)
**Best for:** Standard layouts, budget-conscious builds, or repairs over existing cement board.

**How it works:** A roll-on or trowel-on membrane creates a waterproof barrier directly over the cement board.

**Keys to success:**
- Apply to the **required thickness** (check the label and use a **wet-film gauge**).
- Ensure **complete coverage** at corners, seams, and penetrations.
- Allow full **cure time** before tile.

**Pros:**  
✅ Easy to find at Home Depot  
✅ Flexible around irregular shapes  
✅ Affordable and quick to apply  

**Watch-outs:**  
⚠️ Most failures happen when coats are too thin or missed in corners.  
⚠️ Needs consistent drying time—don’t rush it.

---

## 🟡 Better: Sheet Membrane Systems (e.g., Schluter® KERDI)
**Best for:** Full shower rebuilds where you want consistent, testable waterproofing.

**How it works:** Thinset-bonded sheets overlap to form a continuous barrier, sealed with banding and corners.

**Pros:**  
✅ Waterproof right at the surface—no moisture soaking into the backer  
✅ Easy to **flood test** before tile  
✅ Long track record in both DIY and professional installs  

**Watch-outs:**  
⚠️ Roll seams tight and follow overlap requirements.  
⚠️ Use the correct thinset (usually **unmodified** for Schluter).  
⚠️ Plan corner details before you start—folds matter.

---

## 🟣 Best: Foam Board + Integrated Pan (e.g., KERDI-Board®, GoBoard®)
**Best for:** Full rebuilds, large-format tile, or tight deadlines where precision and speed both matter.

**How it works:** Lightweight foam boards create a waterproof substrate and tie into a prefabricated pan and drain kit.

**Pros:**  
✅ Ultra-flat planes for **large-format tile**  
✅ No fasteners through wet zones when detailed right  
✅ Lighter and cleaner handling on site  

**Watch-outs:**  
⚠️ Use the manufacturer’s **fasteners, washers, tapes, and sealants**—mixing brands voids warranties.  
⚠️ Double-check screw spacing and seal all penetrations.

## 💡 The Pro Angle: Why Method Matters More Than Brand

All three systems—liquid, sheet, and foam—can perform beautifully **if** installed correctly. The weak link is never the product; it’s the **method**.

At **Tillerstead**, we:
- Install to **manufacturer and ANSI standards** (A118.10 / A118.12).  
- Use **movement joints** per TCNA EJ171.  
- Perform **flood tests** where required.  
- Document prep and waterproofing with photos before tile goes up.

That means you can pick up your favorite system at Home Depot, and we’ll make sure it’s **assembled right**, not just “stuck together.”

**Bottom line:**  
You can buy quality waterproofing materials at any big-box store—but durability comes from how they’re detailed, sealed, and documented.  

If you’re in **South Jersey or Atlantic County**, we’re happy to help you plan the right mix of DIY + professional installation.
