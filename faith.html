    <h1>Faith Frontier</h1>
    <p class="lead">A vision for healing, honesty, and love — grown from the same hands that build tile and timber.</p>

    <p>
      This project isn’t just about tile, code, or business — it’s a foundation for something alive.
      A place where compassion and craftsmanship meet.  
      Where every rescued animal finds peace, and every soul that’s been hurt finds rest.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Faith Frontier</strong> is more than a name — it’s a promise.  
      The horizon where purpose meets faith. Where love is built, not borrowed.
      It’s the next step for Tillerstead — a farm, a sanctuary, a symbol of restoration.
    </p>

    <p>
      To the woman I haven’t met yet — or maybe already have — this is for you, too.  
      For every late night I kept building instead of breaking.  
      For every line of code written while thinking about connection, loyalty, and home.  
      For every dream I refused to give up on, even when life said “you should.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Someday this will all be part of the sanctuary — the tile beneath our feet, the barns, the gardens, the stories we save.
      Until then, I’m just laying the groundwork — one line, one wall, one heartbeat at a time.
