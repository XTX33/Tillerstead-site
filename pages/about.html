      <p>
        I'm Tyler—a licensed contractor with more than a decade of hands-on experience in property maintenance,
        remodeling, and tile installation. My work spans occupied homes, rental units, and small commercial spaces,
        which has taught me to balance quality craftsmanship with respect for tenants and tight schedules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's a recurring maintenance visit, a kitchen remodel, or a waterproof shower rebuild,
        every project follows documented processes and industry standards to minimize callbacks and ensure long-term durability.
