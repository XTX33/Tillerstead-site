    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Devon Tyler, founder and licensed contractor
      (NJ HIC <strong>13VH10808800</strong>). I manage every project personally and
      stand behind the work with clear documentation and service follow-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is simple: deliver craft you can trust—showers that don’t leak,
      floors that stay true, and kitchens that feel like home.

  <h2 id="standards-title">Professional Materials &amp; Standards</h2>
  <p>
    Every Tillerstead installation is built to meet or exceed national tile-setting
    standards. For waterproofing in showers, tubs, and wet areas, we use membranes
    that comply with
    <a href="http://mmsausa.com/products/setting_material/smmwpA118.10"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      ANSI A118.10: Load-Bearing, Bonded Waterproof Membranes
    </a>,
    helping ensure moisture stays where it belongs—away from your framing and subfloor.
  </p>
  <p>
    All layouts, coverage, and movement control follow
    <a href="https://tcnatile.com/resource-center/ansi-standards/"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      ANSI A108 installation standards
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.custombuildingproducts.com/media/61685982/CEJ-171-WPM-Waterproofing-Movement-Joint-Details-Combined.pdf"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      TCNA EJ171 movement-joint guidelines
    </a>.
    These standards define proper substrate prep, full mortar coverage, and flexible
    perimeter joints—preventing cracks, debonding, and tenting over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short: the work you see is built on what you don’t see—sound structure,
    bonded waterproofing, and industry-informed technique.

  <h2>Common Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Are you licensed and insured?</summary>
    <p>
      <strong>New Jersey Licensed Home Improvement Contractor.</strong><br>
      Tillerstead LLC is registered as a New Jersey Home Improvement Contractor.<br>
      <strong>NJ HIC #13VH10808800</strong>
    </p>
    <!-- If/when you have current insurance coverage in place, you can expand this
         to explicitly say "licensed and insured" with policy details if desired. -->
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do you work with large-format tile?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Large-format tile demands very flat substrates, proper mortar selection,
      and the right trowel techniques. We follow ANSI A108 and TCNA EJ171 guidance
      so big tile installs stay flat and secure over time.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do you waterproof behind and under tile?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. In showers, tub surrounds, and other high-moisture areas, we install
      membranes that meet the
      <a href="http://mmsausa.com/products/setting_material/smmwpA118.10"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        ANSI A118.10 waterproofing standard
      </a>.
      That’s what keeps water out of your framing and subfloor for the long term.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What are movement joints, and why do they matter?</summary>
    <p>
      Movement joints are flexible gaps built into tile installations to absorb
      expansion and contraction from temperature, humidity, or building movement.
      Instead of rigid grout, these joints use flexible sealant—often 100% silicone—
      to allow slight movement without cracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      We install perimeter, change-of-plane, and field joints according to
      <a href="https://www.custombuildingproducts.com/media/61685982/CEJ-171-WPM-Waterproofing-Movement-Joint-Details-Combined.pdf"
