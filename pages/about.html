    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I’m <strong>Devon Tyler</strong>, founder of Tillerstead and a New Jersey licensed contractor
      (<strong>HIC #13VH10808800</strong>). I manage every project personally — from scope and layout
      to punch list — and stand behind the work with clear documentation and service follow-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is simple: <strong>deliver craft you can trust</strong> — showers that don’t leak,
      floors that stay true, and kitchens that feel like home instead of a construction zone.
    </p>

  <h2 id="standards-title">Professional Materials &amp; Standards</h2>
  <p>
    Every Tillerstead installation is built to meet or exceed national tile-setting standards.
    In wet areas — showers, tubs, and other high-moisture zones — we use membranes that comply with
    <a href="http://mmsausa.com/products/setting_material/smmwpA118.10"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      <strong>ANSI A118.10</strong> load-bearing, bonded waterproofing requirements
    </a>,
    helping keep moisture away from framing, subfloor, and adjacent finishes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Layout, coverage, and movement control follow
    <a href="https://tcnatile.com/resource-center/ansi-standards/"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      <strong>ANSI A108</strong> installation standards
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.custombuildingproducts.com/media/61685982/CEJ-171-WPM-Waterproofing-Movement-Joint-Details-Combined.pdf"
       target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      <strong>TCNA EJ171</strong> movement-joint guidelines
    </a>.
    These define proper substrate prep, full mortar coverage, and flexible perimeter joints —
    the details that prevent cracks, debonding, and tenting over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short: <strong>what you see is backed by what you don’t see</strong> — sound structure,
    bonded waterproofing, and industry-informed technique.

  <h2>Common Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Are you licensed and insured?</summary>
    <p>
      <strong>New Jersey Licensed Home Improvement Contractor</strong><br>
      Tillerstead LLC is registered as a New Jersey Home Improvement Contractor.<br>
      <strong>NJ HIC #13VH10808800</strong>
    </p>
    <!-- When current insurance coverage is in place, this can be expanded to say
         "licensed and insured" with basic policy details if you want to show that upfront. -->
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do you work with large-format tile?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Large-format tile demands very flat substrates, the right mortar, and the right trowel
      techniques. Tillerstead follows <strong>ANSI A108</strong> and <strong>TCNA EJ171</strong>
      guidance so big tile installs stay flat, bonded, and in plane over time.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do you waterproof behind and under tile?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. In showers, tub surrounds, and other high-moisture areas, we install membranes that meet the
      <a href="http://mmsausa.com/products/setting_material/smmwpA118.10"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        <strong>ANSI A118.10</strong> waterproofing standard
      </a>.
      That’s what keeps water out of your framing and subfloor for the long term.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What are movement joints, and why do they matter?</summary>
    <p>
      Movement joints are flexible gaps built into tile installations to absorb expansion and contraction
      from temperature, humidity, or building movement. Instead of rigid grout, these joints use flexible
      sealant — often 100% silicone — so the system can move slightly without cracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tillerstead installs perimeter, change-of-plane, and field joints according to
      <a href="https://www.custombuildingproducts.com/media/61685982/CEJ-171-WPM-Waterproofing-Movement-Joint-Details-Combined.pdf"
