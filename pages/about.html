  <!-- Professional Materials & Standards -->

    <h2 id="standards-title">Professional Materials &amp; Standards</h2>
    <p>
      Every Tillerstead installation is built to meet or exceed national tile-setting standards. 
      For waterproofing in showers, tubs, and wet areas, we use membranes that comply with
      <a href="http://mmsausa.com/products/setting_material/smmwpA118.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ANSI A118.10: Load-Bearing, Bonded Waterproof Membranes</a>, 
      ensuring moisture stays where it belongs—behind the tile, not in your walls or framing.
    </p>
    <p>
      All layouts, coverage, and expansion control follow 
      <a href="https://tcnatile.com/resource-center/ansi-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ANSI A108 installation standards</a> 
      and 
      <a href="https://www.custombuildingproducts.com/media/61685982/CEJ-171-WPM-Waterproofing-Movement-Joint-Details-Combined.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCNA EJ171 movement-joint guidelines</a>. 
      These standards define proper substrate prep, full mortar coverage, and flexible perimeter joints—preventing cracks, debonding, and tenting over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short: the work you see is built on what you don’t see—sound structure, bonded waterproofing, and industry-certified technique.

    <h2>Common Questions</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>Are you licensed and insured?</summary>
      <p>
        <strong>Fully Licensed, Bonded, and Insured.</strong><br>
        Tillerstead LLC is a registered New Jersey Home Improvement Contractor, holding all required credentials and active insurance coverage for your protection.<br>

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you work with large-format tile?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. We specialize in large-format installations, ensuring proper substrate preparation, flatness, and coverage. We use manufacturer-approved mortars, trowels, and movement joints in full accordance with ANSI A108 and TCNA EJ171 standards for durability and precision.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you waterproof behind and under tile?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes. In showers, tub surrounds, and floors with high moisture exposure, we install membranes that meet the 
        <a href="http://mmsausa.com/products/setting_material/smmwpA118.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ANSI A118.10 waterproofing standard</a>. 
        This ensures complete moisture protection and peace of mind for years to come.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What are movement joints, and why do they matter?</summary>
      <p>
        Movement joints are flexible gaps built into tile installations to absorb natural expansion and contraction caused by temperature, humidity, or building movement. 
        Unlike rigid grout, these joints are filled with flexible sealant—like 100% silicone—to allow for slight movement without cracking.
      </p>
      <p>
        We install all perimeter, change-of-plane, and field joints according to 
        <a href="https://www.custombuildingproducts.com/media/61685982/CEJ-171-WPM-Waterproofing-Movement-Joint-Details-Combined.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCNA EJ171 recommendations</a> 
        and 
        <a href="https://tcnatile.com/resource-center/ansi-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ANSI A108 installation standards</a>. 
        This protects your tile system from cracks, tenting, and premature failure.
