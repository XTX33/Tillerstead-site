    <h2 id="plans-heading">Monthly Maintenance Plans</h2>
    <p>
      Monthly plans give you a steady point of contact for small issues, routine checks, and minor repairs.
      Each visit is scheduled in advance, documented, and focused on practical upkeep — not emergency service
      or full building inspections.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plans are a good fit for homeowners, landlords, and small commercial properties who want one contractor
      they trust to keep an eye on things, handle the small work, and flag anything that needs a specialist.

      <h3>How the Plans Work</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Initial walkthrough:</strong> We review the property together, note recurring concerns, and agree on a realistic scope for the plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduled visits:</strong> Visits are set on a monthly or seasonal rhythm, with clear windows for arrival and a defined list of tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> After each visit, you receive notes and photos summarizing what was inspected, repaired, or recommended.</li>
        <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> If we find issues outside the scope of the plan, you’ll get straightforward recommendations and, where appropriate, referrals to licensed specialists.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="plans-scope">
      <h3>Scope &amp; Limitations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plans focus on routine upkeep, minor repairs, and visual checks. They are not emergency services or full code-compliance inspections.</li>
        <li>Major plumbing, electrical, HVAC, roofing, structural work, or life-safety issues are referred to appropriate licensed trades.</li>
        <li>Some tasks may depend on safe access, weather, and site conditions and may be rescheduled if needed.</li>
        <li>Materials and third-party costs are either client-supplied or billed as agreed in writing before work is performed.</li>
        <li>All work is performed under a written service agreement and/or individual work orders that define final scope, pricing, and responsibilities.</li>
      </ul>
