      <h2>Flexible Financing for Tile &amp; Bath Work</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Good prep, waterproofing, and layout are long-term decisions. If you’d rather not cut corners
        to fit everything into one month’s budget, we can price the project clearly and connect you with
        financing options that match the scope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tillerstead doesn’t mark up rates or play games with “teaser” pricing. The sequence is simple:
        define the work, put it in writing, and then decide whether to pay in full, phase the project,
        or use third-party financing.
      </p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ol class="financing-steps">
        <li><strong>Scope the project:</strong> We walk through your space, talk through goals, and map out phases if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Price it clearly:</strong> You get a written, line-item estimate — labor, materials, and any options.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose payment approach:</strong> Pay in full, phase the work, or apply for financing through Acorn Finance.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="microcopy">
        Financing isn’t required for any project. It’s just another tool to keep the work done right,
        instead of dialing back waterproofing, prep, or materials to fit a rushed budget.
