  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <h2>1. General Terms</h2>
  <p>
    All content and materials on this website are provided for informational purposes only.
    Nothing on this site constitutes a binding proposal, estimate, or legal agreement.
    Any service, pricing, or schedule becomes binding only through a written proposal
    or contract signed by both Tillerstead LLC and the client.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Services &amp; Estimates</h2>
  <p>
    Estimates shared by phone, email, messaging, or through this website are non-binding
    until confirmed in writing. Actual scope, materials, and costs may vary based on site
    conditions, availability, and client selections. Tillerstead LLC reserves the right to
    revise or withdraw an estimate if project details change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Work is performed only as described in the final written scope of work, proposal,
    or contract. Changes requested afterward may require a written change order and
    adjusted pricing or scheduling.
