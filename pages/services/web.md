  <h1>Websites That Feel Like Your Work, Not a Template</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Tillerstead builds quiet, reliable sites for small businesses, tradesmen, and local organizations
    who want to look legitimate online without getting dragged into a full-time tech job.
  </p>

  <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
  <p>
    These services are designed for people who actually work with their hands or serve real clients:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Skilled trades (tile, carpentry, electrical, plumbing, remodeling)</li>
    <li>Small shops and local businesses (cafés, salons, training studios, independent professionals)</li>
    <li>Faith communities, ministries, and nonprofits who need a clean, trustworthy web presence</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you want something fast, honest, and durable – not hype, pop-ups, and dark-pattern marketing – you’re in the right place.

  <div class="feature-grid">
    <article class="feature-card">

        <li>Version-controlled code you can back up and keep forever</li>

    </article>

    <article class="feature-card">
      <h3>Written for Real People</h3>
      <p>
        Content is drafted in plain language so your clients actually understand:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What you do</li>
        <li>Where you work</li>
        <li>How to contact you</li>

  <h2>How the Process Works</h2>
  <ol class="numbered-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Short intake.</strong><br>
      You share your current materials: business name, logo (if you have one), photos of your work,
      rough list of services, and any testimonials or reviews you like.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Structure &amp; copy draft.</strong><br>
      Tillerstead proposes a simple site map (usually 3–5 pages) and drafts copy in your voice:
      straightforward, respectful, and accurate.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Design &amp; build.</strong><br>
      The site is implemented with clean HTML/CSS, responsive for phones and desktops, with attention
      to typography and readability.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Review &amp; revisions.</strong><br>
      You review the site, request changes, and we adjust until it matches your work and your standards.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Launch &amp; handoff.</strong><br>
      The site goes live under your domain. You receive a simple guide for future edits and access
      to the code repository.
    </li>
  </ol>
