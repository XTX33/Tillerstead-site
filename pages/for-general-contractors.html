        <p>
          Working with busy build teams means clarity from the first email. Here is what you can expect when you bring Tillerstead onto a job:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Estimates:</strong> Send plans, takeoffs, or site photos. You get a written proposal outlining scope, prep, waterproofing, tile layout notes, and allowances for trims or accessories.</li>
          <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Once approved, target dates are confirmed in writing with a readiness checklist covering framing, mechanicals, and materials. You receive confirmations one week and one day before mobilization.</li>
          <li><strong>Change orders:</strong> Scope changes are documented the day they surface with clear pricing and approval signatures so billing matches the work performed.</li>
          <li><strong>Daily communication:</strong> Text or email updates outline progress, upcoming inspections, and what the next trade needs to know before stepping in.</li>
          <li><strong>Punchlists:</strong> Work wraps with photo documentation, cleanup, and a signed completion report to make your closeout painless.</li>
        </ul>
