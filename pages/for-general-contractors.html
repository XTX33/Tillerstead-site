      <p>
        Working with busy build teams requires clarity from the start. Here’s what you can expect when Tillerstead joins your project:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Estimates:</strong> Send plans, takeoffs, or site photos. You’ll receive a written proposal outlining scope, prep and substrate requirements, waterproofing details, layout notes, and allowances for trims or accessories.</li>

        <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Once approved, target dates are confirmed in writing with a readiness checklist covering framing, mechanicals, materials, and site access. You receive reminders one week and one day before mobilization.</li>

        <li><strong>Change Orders:</strong> Any scope adjustments are documented the day they surface, with clear pricing and written approval so billing tracks the actual work performed.</li>

        <li><strong>Daily Communication:</strong> Brief text or email updates outline progress, upcoming inspections, material needs, and what the next trade should know before stepping in.</li>

        <li><strong>Punchlists:</strong> Work finishes with photo documentation, cleanup, and a signed completion report to make your closeout straightforward.</li>
      </ul>
