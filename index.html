    <h2 id="faq-heading">South Jersey Tile &amp; Home Upgrade FAQ</h2>
    <div class="faqs mt-1">
      <details>
        <summary>Do you only work on bathrooms?</summary>
        <p>
          No. Bathrooms and showers are a big part of the work, but Tillerstead also handles kitchen
          backsplashes, floor tile in living areas and entries, and select small home upgrades where tile
          and finish work make the biggest impact.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What areas of South Jersey do you serve?</summary>
        <p>
          Most projects are in Atlantic County — Galloway, Egg Harbor Township, Northfield, Linwood,
          Brigantine, and neighboring towns. For multi-day installs, travel to parts of Ocean and Cape May
          counties is available.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can you help with design and material choices?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. You can bring your own tile, or lean on recommendations for sizes, trims, grout, and layouts
          that fit your budget and the way the space is used. Every scope includes guidance on waterproofing
          and movement joints so the installation holds up over time.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Are you licensed as a New Jersey home improvement contractor?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Tillerstead is registered as a New Jersey Home Improvement Contractor under license number
          {{ site.company.hic }}. You can confirm current registration at the
          <a href="https://newjersey.mylicense.com/verification/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
            NJ Consumer Affairs license lookup
          </a>.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How do estimates and pricing work?</summary>
        <p>
          Most projects start with a walkthrough or clear photos, followed by a written, itemized estimate
          that separates labor and materials. Homeowners can choose labor-only installation using their own
          tile and fixtures, or a scoped option where materials are sourced and delivered as part of the plan.
