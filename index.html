      <div class="faqs mt-1">
        <details>
          <summary>What areas of South Jersey do you serve?</summary>
          <p>
            Tillerstead focuses on Atlantic County and nearby communities, including Egg Harbor
            Township, Galloway, Northfield, Linwood, Absecon, and surrounding shore towns.
            If you’re close by, feel free to reach out.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Do you help with design and tile selections?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. You can bring your own tile, or we can talk through options for size, finish,
            and layout that work for your space and budget. The goal is to install materials
            that perform well in South Jersey’s climate and daily use.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How far in advance should I schedule a bathroom remodel?</summary>
          <p>
            For full shower or bathroom remodels, it’s best to reach out a few weeks in advance
            so we can walk the space, plan materials, and give you a realistic start date. Smaller
            tile repairs or backsplashes can often be scheduled sooner.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Are you licensed and insured in New Jersey?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. Tillerstead operates as a New Jersey-licensed home improvement contractor and carries
            general liability coverage appropriate for residential work.
