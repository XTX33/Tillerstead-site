    <h2 id="faq-heading">South Jersey Tile &amp; Bath FAQ</h2>
    <div class="faqs mt-1">
      <details>
        <summary>What areas of South Jersey do you serve?</summary>
        <p>
          Tillerstead focuses on Atlantic County and nearby communities, including Egg Harbor Township,
          Galloway, Northfield, Linwood, Brigantine, Longport, and surrounding shore towns. If you’re in
          Ocean or Cape May counties, reach out — travel is available for multi-day installs.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do you help with design and tile selections?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Bring your own tile or lean on recommendations for size, finish, trim, and layout that fit
          your budget. Every scope includes guidance on grout, sealants, and waterproofing systems that
          hold up to South Jersey humidity and rental traffic.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How far in advance should I schedule a bathroom remodel?</summary>
        <p>
          For full shower or bathroom remodels, reach out a few weeks in advance so we can walk the space,
          review waterproofing details, and get permits or inspections scheduled if needed. Smaller tile
          repairs or backsplashes can often be booked on shorter timelines.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Are you licensed and insured in New Jersey?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Tillerstead operates as a New Jersey-licensed home improvement contractor (HIC #{{ site.company.hic }})
          and carries general liability coverage appropriate for residential tile and bath work. Larger projects
          can be bonded or insured to match the scope while keeping craftsmanship standards fixed.
